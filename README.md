StarfishVM
========
An emulator for custom computer architecture.  The architecture is designed as a 16bit computer that could be implemented with logic gates on a circuit board, not just in software.  Inspiration for the hardware design came from https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU, http://www.bigmessowires.com/ and http://www.homebrewcpu.com/.

When the virtual machine is done, it will be programmed with an as-of now un-named assembly language(IL?) and a systems programming language (orange-lang) that compliles to the assembly.

The documentation(not much) is currently at this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/ScratchOs/starfish/wiki).

Currently, the emulator is progressing, and the language is still being designed.
